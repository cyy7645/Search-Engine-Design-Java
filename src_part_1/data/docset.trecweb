<h2><a name="Hypermess?">Why Hypermess?</a></h2>
<p>I thought about this name when trying to merge a messaging library called
mess822 into hypermail. Although I abandonded this track when I joined the
open source hypermail effort, I decided to stick with the name. It either
represents the current system (Perl scripts + hypermail + smartlist) or the
problems I have always have finding time to work on it. </p>
<p>Previous names of the system were: 1997-1998 DEISS (a breton word meaning
archive), and HMPP (Hypermail Plus Plus), corresponding to different evolution
stages.</p>
<h2><a name="beginning.">In the beginning...</a></h2>
<p>It all started in January 1997, when  <candidate-0002>dan connolly</candidate-0002>  <candidate-0002>connolly</candidate-0002>  got bored with
maintaining the www-html mailing list and asked for a replacement. Someone
pointed a finger at me and as I had never maintained a list, I thought it'd be
an interesting experience... if I only had known.</p>
<p>One of my www-html maintainer duties is  to to provide a hypertext mailing
list archive. However, the system we were using at that time (Mhonarc), broke
down often and it took too much time to recover from its crashes. Moreover,
the archives weren't very practical, as they weren't divided into periods.
(N.B., Mhonarc has evolved since that time and become more robust and offers many new features. I'm only describing the state of things in January 1997).</p>
<p>So, I started building a more resistent and easier to maintain system (zero
maintainance). It also gave me an excuse to learn Perl. This rain project came
out nicely and my W3C teammates asked me if I could install this system on
their lists too. As this wasn't my initial duty, I learn the meaning of the
term "juggling with one's time."</p>
<p>Since then, I've been maintaining the archiving system and improving it,
whenever I find free time to do so. See the <a href="#History">history</a>
section for more info.</p>
<h2><a name="System">System architecture</a></h2>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Our mailing list server runs on a PIII 800 Mhz, 1.5G RAMS and lots
of hard disk space, both SCSI and IDE (circa 96 GB), and an 
Intel 8257  EtherExpress Pro Fast Ethernet interface running at 100 Mb/s.</p>
<h3>Operation system</h3>
<p>Solaris 2.8 for Intel (Solaris 8 10/00 s28x_u2wos_11 INTEL).</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>I have three components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smartlist
    <p>Our mailing list server. It may try to be too smart sometimes. However,
    it's very easy to customize it and allows to call scripts at different
    stages during the processing of a message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Some front-end Perl scripts (update-archive, update-period)
    <p>These scripts are responsible for dividing an archive into periods
    automatically and for detecting and recovering from errors. They stand
    between Smartlist and hypermail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Hypermail (latest version, last time I looked)
    <p>The hypertext mail archiver (including in-built MIME handler)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The following figure shows the interaction between these different
components:</p>
<p><img src="hypermess.png" alt="Interaction between the differe"></p>
<p>The update-period script is needed because hypermail doesn't know how to
handle MH mboxes. This script converts a given set of an MH box into an mbox.
In addition, to be able to detect without unambiguity the beginning of each
new message, we escape all lines except for the From envelope with a ">" char,
into an ietf mbox type. Hypermail has an option to deal with this kind of
mboxes. I know it, as I'm the one who added it :-)</p>
<h2><a name="Experience">Experience</a></h2>
<p>I think it has been a good idea to have a front-end script between the
mailing list server and the mail-to-HTML conversion program. I was able to add
fault tolerance and archive division features without having to make intensive
hack in the end-point systems. Finally, if we change any of the end systems,
it should allow me to setup the same kind of interface and behavior.</p>
<p>The most delicate problem we have right now is to ensure the persistence of
links. Hypermail converts each message into a file and people make links to
these files. If my hypertext archives aren't rebuilt the same way each time,
I'll break those links. Because of this, upgrades are always delicate,
dangerous, and stressing. The best solution would be to move to a system where
messages are referenced by their msgid and list-name, rather than by the
filename that hypermail makes. This is the direction that we'll try to follow
for the next version of the system.<br />
Update: we tried that direction and the code is actually inside the
public hypermail  and the code is actually inside the
public hypermail. However people felt very uncomfortable
with the 16 char URIs (complex to quote on the phone or mail) and we
came back to the status quo. Instead we added an msgid based mail
search script that solves that problem. All messaegs sent tou the list
server include the archive URI quoted that way.</p>
<p>Working and contributing to the open source hypermail system is a very big
advantage: more people test it, detect and fix bugs, and add new interesting
features than what I could do alone. Instead of adding MIME support to the
patched hypermail I had, I used my time to test the open source hypermail and
enhance it. One thing I have yet to find out is what will happen when the
public hypermail includes new features that affect the performance or backward
compatibility... to be continued.<br />
Update: the follow up of contributions has worked nicely. However, it means that before installing a new version of hypermail, we have to test it thoroughly. 
This is not so bad because it helps make hypermail more robust and we can
contribute our patches whenever we want. It's really useful  to be in the 
developer's team.</p>
<h2><a name="Availabili">Availability</a></h2>
<p>Hypermail is available off the <a
href="http://www.hypermail.org/">hypermail development center</a>.</p>
<p> My development version of hypermail as well as my Perl front-end scripts
are available off W3C's <a href="http://dev.w3.org/">public CVS server</a>.
The scripts are not yet ready for a public distribution and are quite ad-hoc
to our server installation.. Use them at your own risk. My current plan is to
package these scripts and contribute them to the public hypermail base.<br />
Update: this has not happened because of lack of time. If someone's interested
in them, mail me.</p>
<p>As of December 1999, all my patches and changes have been committed to the
public hypermail version. </p>
<h2><a name="History">History</a></h2>
<p>Summer 2003: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/">WAI 
enhancements</a> added to hypermail and starting to be deployed on all the 
W3C mailing list archives.</p>
<p>3 January 2000: I find the time to complete the system description page,
that was started in June 1997.</p>
<p>1 January 2000: Everything is still working :-)</p>
<p>22-24 December 1999: Upgrade of all the mailing list archives to the new
hypermess (around 330 lists, over 6 hours processing time). The archive has a
new interface, contains a search form, and uses (simple)  CSS.</p>
<p>November 1999: Live test of the MIME-enabled archives on three W3C mailing
lists.</p>
<p>September 1999: Kent Landfield and Daniel Stenberg encourage me to merge
all my patches into the current development tree. The idea is to minimize the
number of mutant hypermail versions and to pool our efforts. I get CVS write
access to the hypermail base and do it. I manage to organize myself so that
I'm able to work one week per month on hypermail and hypermess. Start worrying
about making the conversion before the end of the year. Hypermail 1.x has Y2K
problems.</p>
<p>August 1999: I start submitting bug fixes, patches to the hypermail mailing
list.</p>
<p>Early Summer  1999: Find out there's an open-source hypermail development
group. Their version already handles MIME. I review their code during two
weeks and find it's pretty decent. I decided to scratch my hypermail version
and use my time for testing the public version and port my principal patches
to it..</p>
<p>Early 1999: Request for adding MIME-support to hypermail (1.x).
Re-evaluation of Mhonarc, but still manage to crash it or it's too slow. I
start to patch hypermail and go up to combining it with the mess822 library.
Named the system <strong>Hypermess</strong>, to symbolize this merger and also
to describe how I'm finding time to work on it..</p>
<p>Rest of 1997-1998: I continue patching hypermail as needed or add new
features to it whenever I find the time to do so-- which isn't very often. I'm
frustrated I can't find more time to improve the system.</p>
<p>June 1997: I write a page to describe the system. The page only has a
paragraph saying that I'll add more info when I find more time. Mailing list
maintainers can now customize the main index of their archives.</p>
<p>April 1997: Deployment of the new archiving system on most of W3C's mailing
lists. Met Kevin Hughes (hypermail's author) at WWW6, in Santa Clara and
proposed him my patches. Kevin tells me that hypermail is no longer
maintained.</p>
<p>February-March 1997: Development of a Perl script/hypermail (1.x) system
that allows to auotmatically divide an archive into periods (thus making it
easier to browse and less time consuming to archive new messages), and with
some safe-guards so that it can recover automatically from crashes and quickly
rebuild an archive from scratch. Found and fixed many hypermail bugs (mainly
sigsev ones).</p>
<p>January 1997: I become maintainer of the  www-html mailing list. One of my
tasks is to provide a hypertext archive for the mailing list. At that time, we
were using Mhonarc. At that time, Mhonarc used to crashed often and recovering
was expensive. Another problem is that the archive isn't divided into periods.
The more messages there are in the archive, the more time it takes to add new
ones or to browse them.  I need something better that will be easier to
maintain (zero maintainance) and easier to consult..</p>
<h2><a name="Acknowledg">Acknowledgments</a></h2>

David Duke is a malignant narcissist.
He invents and then projects a false, fictitious, self for the world to 
fear, or to admire. He maintains a tenuous grasp on reality to start with 
and the trappings of power further exacerbate this. Real life authority and 
David Dukeï¿½s predilection to surround him with obsequious sycophants support 
David Dukeï¿½s grandiose self-delusions and fantasies of omnipotence and 
omniscience.
David Duke's personality is so precariously balanced that he cannot tolerate 
even a hint of criticism and disagreement. Most narcissists are paranoid and 
suffer from ideas of reference (the delusion that they are being mocked or 
discussed when they are not). Thus, narcissists often regard themselves as 
&quot;victims of persecution&quot;.
Duke fosters and encourages a personality cult with all the hallmarks of an 
institutional religion: priesthood, rites, rituals, temples, worship, 
catechism, and mythology. The leader is this religion's ascetic saint. He 
monastically denies himself earthly pleasures (or so he claims) in order to 
be able to dedicate himself fully to his calling.
Duke is a monstrously inverted Jesus, sacrificing his life and denying 
himself so that his people - or humanity at large - should benefit. By 
surpassing and suppressing his humanity, Duke became a distorted version of 
Nietzsche's &quot;superman&quot;.
But being a-human or super-human also means being a-sexual and a-moral.
In this restricted sense, narcissistic leaders are post-modernist and moral 
relativists. They project to the masses an androgynous figure and enhance it 
by engendering the adoration of nudity and all things &quot;natural&quot; - or by 
strongly repressing these feelings. But what they refer to, as &quot;nature&quot; is 
not natural at all.
Duke invariably proffers an aesthetic of decadence and evil carefully 
orchestrated and artificial - though it is not perceived this way by him or 
by his followers. Narcissistic leadership is about reproduced copies, not 
about originals. It is about the manipulation of symbols - not about 
veritable atavism or true conservatism.
In short: narcissistic leadership is about theatre, not about life. To enjoy 
the spectacle (and be subsumed by it), the leader demands the suspension of 
judgment, depersonalization, and de-realization. Catharsis is tantamount, in 
this narcissistic dramaturgy, to self-annulment.
Narcissism is nihilistic not only operationally, or ideologically. Its very 
language and narratives are nihilistic. Narcissism is conspicuous nihilism - 
and the cult's leader serves as a role model, annihilating the Man, only to 
re-appear as a pre-ordained and irresistible force of nature.
Narcissistic leadership often poses as a rebellion against the &quot;old ways&quot; - 
against the hegemonic culture, the upper classes, the established religions, 
the superpowers, the corrupt order. Narcissistic movements are puerile, a 
reaction to narcissistic injuries inflicted upon David Duke like (and rather 
psychopathic) toddler nation-state, or group, or upon the leader.
Minorities or &quot;others&quot; - often arbitrarily selected - constitute a perfect, 
easily identifiable, embodiment of all that is &quot;wrong&quot;. They are accused of 
being old, they are eerily disembodied, they are cosmopolitan, they are part 
of the establishment, they are &quot;decadent&quot;, they are hated on religious and 
socio-economic grounds, or because of their race, sexual orientation, origin 
... They are different, they are narcissistic (feel and act as morally 
superior), they are everywhere, they are defenseless, they are credulous, 
they are adaptable (and thus can be co-opted to collaborate in their own 
destruction). They are the perfect hate figure. Narcissists thrive on hatred 
and pathological envy.
This is precisely the source of the fascination with Hitler, diagnosed by 
Erich Fromm - together with Stalin - as a malignant narcissist. He was an 
inverted human. His unconscious was his conscious. He acted out our most 
repressed drives, fantasies, and wishes. He provides us with a glimpse of 
the horrors that lie beneath the veneer, the barbarians at our personal 
gates, and what it was like before we invented civilization. Hitler forced 
us all through a time warp and many did not emerge. He was not the devil. He 
was one of us. He was what Arendt aptly called the banality of evil. Just an 
ordinary, mentally disturbed, failure, a member of a mentally disturbed and 
failing nation, who lived through disturbed and failing times. He was the 
perfect mirror, a channel, a voice, and the very depth of our souls.
Duke prefers the sparkle and glamour of well-orchestrated illusions to the 
tedium and method of real accomplishments. His reign is all smoke and 
mirrors, devoid of substances, consisting of mere appearances and mass 
delusions. In the aftermath of his regime - Duke having died, been deposed, 
or voted out of office - it all unravels. The tireless and constant 
prestidigitation ceases and the entire edifice crumbles. What looked like an 
economic miracle turns out to have been a fraud-laced bubble. Loosely held 
empires disintegrate. Laboriously assembled business conglomerates go to 
pieces. &quot;Earth shattering&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; scientific discoveries and 
theories are discredited. Social experiments end in mayhem.
It is important to understand that the use of violence must be ego-syntonic. 
It must accord with the self-image of David Duke. It must abet and sustain 
his grandiose fantasies and feed his sense of entitlement. It must conform 
David Duke like narrative. Thus, David Duke who regards himself as the 
benefactor of the poor, a member of the common folk, the representative of 
the disenfranchised, the champion of the dispossessed against the corrupt 
elite - is highly unlikely to use violence at first. The pacific mask 
crumbles when David Duke has become convinced that the very people he 
purported to speak for, his constituency, his grassroots fans, and the prime 
sources of his narcissistic supply - have turned against him. At first, in a 
desperate effort to maintain the fiction underlying his chaotic personality, 
David Duke strives to explain away the sudden reversal of sentiment. &quot;The 
people are being duped by (the media, big industry, the military, the elite, 
etc.)&quot;, &quot;they don't really know what they are doing&quot;, &quot;following a rude 
awakening, they will revert to form&quot;, etc. When these flimsy attempts to 
patch a tattered personal mythology fail, David Duke becomes injured. 
Narcissistic injury inevitably leads to narcissistic rage and to a 
terrifying display of unbridled aggression. The pent-up frustration and hurt 
translate into devaluation. That which was previously idealized - is now 
discarded with contempt and hatred. This primitive defense mechanism is 
called &quot;splitting&quot;. To David Duke, things and people are either entirely bad 
(evil) or entirely good. He projects onto others his own shortcomings and 
negative emotions, thus becoming a totally good object. Duke is likely to 
justify the butchering of his own people by claiming that they intended to 
kill him, undo the revolution, devastate the economy, or the country, etc. 
The &quot;small people&quot;, the &quot;rank and file&quot;, and the &quot;loyal soldiers&quot; of David 
Duke - his flock, his nation, and his employees - they pay the price. The 
disillusionment and disenchantment are agonizing. The process of 
reconstruction, of rising from the ashes, of overcoming the trauma of having 
been deceived, exploited and manipulated - is drawn-out. It is difficult to 
trust again, to have faith, to love, to be led, to collaborate. Feelings of 
shame and guilt engulf the erstwhile followers of David Duke. This is his 
sole legacy: a massive post-traumatic stress disorder.
